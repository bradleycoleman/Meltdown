## Ideal Pathway
In order to progress through all dialogue sequences and game levels, we have cheat codes that can be used.
 - The Enter button can be used to quickly progress through menus and dialogues
 - CTRL+T can be used when inside a game level to grant the player points
 - CTRL+E can be used to end a level at any time, in conjunction with CTRL+T being pressed multiple times beforehand, the player can quickly finish a level with a score high enough to progress onwards

A combination of the above three methods can progress through all levels and screens in the game very quickly.

Other game highlights outside of the core gameplay and dialogue are the settings and high score screens in the main menu
 - The settings scren includes a number of settings, as well as our skin customisation system
  - The high scores screen shows the player's top 5 high scores for each level, and provides the ability to reset these scores
